# What's in my RC 2021
5/29/2021 - Henry Unite

Welcome to a tour of my `.zshrc` file! I thought it would be fun to take a dive into the different tools I use to elevate my developer game.

**If you want to see my whole config, I keep all my setup files on GitHub:** https://github.com/unitehenry/config

## Tools I Use

Before we dive into my configuration, here are the tools I use that help me speed up my tasks as a developer:

`fzf` | [Fuzzy File Finder](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)

`pandoc` | [Pandoc Document Converter](https://pandoc.org)

`brew` | [MacOS Package Manager](https://brew.sh)

## The Variables

```sh
# EDITOR
export EDITOR="vi";
export VISUAL="vi";

# iCloud Directory
export DOCS="/Users/henryunite/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs";

# Work Directory
export WORK="/Users/henryunite/Projects/bicycletransit";
```

Pretty straightforward, but these are what I use to:

* Default editing to be opened in vim
* Reference my iCloud directory which I use to keep all my personal files
* A quick reference to where I keep all my work repositories, notes, projects

## Credentials

```sh
# Credentials Fetcher
function username() {
  export PASS_BACK_PATH=$(pwd);
  cd $DOCS/passwords;
  echo $(decrypt-file $(fzf) | grep "Username:" | cut -d ":" -f2) | pbcopy;
  cd $PASS_BACK_PATH && unset PASS_BACK_PATH;
}

function password() {
  export PASS_BACK_PATH=$(pwd);
  cd $DOCS/passwords;
  echo $(decrypt-file $(fzf) | grep "Password:" | cut -d ":" -f2) | pbcopy;
  cd $PASS_BACK_PATH && unset PASS_BACK_PATH;
}
```

There are so many chrome extensions, keychains, any ways to access your passwords. I personally encrypt my passwords in my cloud storage so I can access them by utilizing a `aes-256-cbc` decryption tool.

## File Formatting

```sh
## Code Formatter
function format-file() {
  export FILENAME="$(basename $@)";
  export EXTENSION="${FILENAME##*.}";

  if [ $EXTENSION = 'py' ]
  then
    yapf --in-place $@;
    return 0;
  fi

  if [ $EXTENSION = 'php' ]
  then
    php-cs-fixer fix $@;
    rm .php_cs.cache;
    return 0;
  fi

  npx prettier --write --single-quote $@;

  unset FILENAME; unset EXTENSION;
}
```

File formatter that handles the languages I use on a day-to-day basis. It gets the job done for most file types including JSON, YAML, and even markdown.

## Spell Check

```sh
## Spellcheck
function spellcheck-file() {
  npx spellchecker-cli --files $@;
}
```

When you're writing as much markdown documentation as me, you'll want an easy way to spell check your files.

## What the Commit

```sh
## What the Commit
function wtf() { git commit -am "$(curl http://whatthecommit.com/index.txt)"; }
```

This is a gimmick, but if you ever just want to commit file changes and you just don't know what to say in the commit message, [what the commit](http://whatthecommit.com/) is just a fun resource to get whacky commit messages.

## Cheat Sheet

```sh
## Cheat
function cheat(){ curl https://cheat.sh/"$@"; }
```

There are so many times I use a CLI tool and can't remember simple commands and options that it takes to perform certain tasks. Check out [cheat.sh](https://cheat.sh) if you're looking for an easy way to reference different CLI tools.

## Document Generation

```sh
## Generate Markdown
function generate-doc() { 
  cp -rf . /tmp;
  if [ -n "$2" ]
  then
    pandoc -s $1 -c $2 -o "/tmp/$1.html";
  else
    pandoc -s $1 -o "/tmp/$1.html"; 
  fi
  open "/tmp/$1.html";
}

## Generate Slide
function generate-slide() {
  # https://revealjs.com/config/
  pandoc -t revealjs \
    -V progress="false" \
    -V navigationMode="linear" \
    -V transition="none" \
    -s $1 -o "/tmp/$1.html";
  cp -rf . /tmp;
  open "/tmp/$1.html";
}
```

I use markdown to write documentation all the time, but if I need to send a coworker a document or present a slide with content that is written in markdown, I'll use [pandoc](https://pandoc.org) to generate these intermediary file formats.

It's really nice to leverage CSS when I want to make my documents look nice or need a clean way to look at markdown files.

## File Encryption

```sh
## Encrypt : aes-256-cbc
function encrypt-file() {
  if [ -z $@ ]
  then
    echo -n "Enter Encrypt Phrase: "; read -s ENCRYPTINPUT; echo "\n";
    echo $ENCRYPTINPUT | openssl enc -aes-256-cbc;
    unset ENCRYPTINPUT;
  else
    openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -in $@;
  fi
}

## Decrypt : aes-256-cbc
function decrypt-file() {
  if [ -z $@ ]
  then
    openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc;
  else
    openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -in $@;
  fi
}
```

It's nice to have a quick way to encrypt and decrypt files with sensitive information.

## Homebrew

```sh
## Homebrew Install Script
function install-homebrew() { /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"; }
```

This is just in my configuration in the event that I just want to install [homebrew](https://brew.sh) without copying and pasting the install script from the website.

If I have a new Mac I need to setup, it'll make the setup so much easier.

## Version Managers

```sh
source ~/.nvmrc;
source ~/.rvmrc;
```

I've been using `nvm` and `rvm` to manage my node and ruby installations. They append rc scripts to load into your base rc file which I extract into their own designated files and load them in at the end.
